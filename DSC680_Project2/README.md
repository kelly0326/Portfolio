Predicting American Airlines Stock Prices

This project was about finding a way to predict short-term stock price changes in American Airlines stock by using other airline stock prices and/or vendor stock prices, as well as economic indicators and/or resource prices (i.e., fuel). It included exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preparation, and model evaluation. The linked Jupyter Notebook shows all parts of this project, including the final model evaluation and recommendation.
