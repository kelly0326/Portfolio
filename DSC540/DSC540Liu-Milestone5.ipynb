    "In this milestone, I took the three individual datasets I created in the previous milestones and added them as tables to a mySQL database. I used the mysql_connector package to enable Python in my Jupyter Notebook to access my locally hosted mySQL database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the work of getting the data into and retrieve it from the database, I created several helper functions that allow me to create connections, databases, and tables, as well as retrieve lists and result sets from mySQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the helper functions were setup and tested, I loaded the three datasets into their respective tables and retrieved a list of ZIP codes that will be reused for several other database operations (it contains all the ZIP codes for L.A. proper).\n",
    "\n",
    "After that I decided on which visualizations I want to make, and which data I would need for them. I wrote SQL queries to collect the data from one or more tables, executed them, and funneled the data into Python dataframes, so they can be used in the matplotlib visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then decided on the type of visualizations and wrote the code for each, using the datasets in my new dataframes as a basis, and adding the necessary formatting, such as titles, legends, ticks and whether the axis are logarithmic and whether the tics are in scientific notation or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I added the human readable datasets at the bottom of my Jupyter Notebook."

    "From the visualizations, it seems that there is only a tentative connection between the average home values or unemployment rates in the Los Angeles areas. However, there seems to be a clear indication, that the downtown areas (900xx ZIP codes) have the highest crime rates. They also have the highest average residents per dwelling. My best guess from personal knowledge of the area would be that this is due to the high rate of commercial buildings, high-value condo and high-rises that are adjacent to low-income apartment housing in the downtown area."
