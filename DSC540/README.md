Crime Rates (DSC 540)

In this project, I took three individual datasets, and added them as tables to a mySQL database. I used the mysql_connector package to enable Python in my Jupyter Notebook to access my locally hosted mySQL database server. Using several custom helper functions, I loaded the three datasets into the database. After I decided on which visualizations I want to make, and which data I would need for them. I used SQL queries to collect the data from one or more tables into Python dataframes, and then visualized them using matplotlib.
