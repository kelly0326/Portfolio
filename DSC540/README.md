Crime Rates (DSC 540)

In this project, I took three individual datasets and added them as tables to a MySQL database. I used the mysql_connector package to enable Python in my Jupyter Notebook to access my locally hosted MySQL database server. Using several custom helper functions, I loaded the three datasets into the database. After, I decided on which visualizations I wanted to make and which data I would need for them. I used SQL queries to collect the data from one or more tables into Python data frames and then visualized them using Matplotlib.
