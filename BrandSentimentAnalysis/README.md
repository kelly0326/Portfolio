This project analyzes a brand name (or any query string yielding Google News results) by gauging sentiment across about 100 news articles. 
It gathers URLs via BeautifulSoup, calculates sentiment scores using TextBlob, and aggregates these scores. Results include average sentiment, 
counts of positive, neutral, and negative articles, and a pie chart illustrating brand sentiment.
