Analyzing Customer Churn in the Telecommunication Industry (DSC 630)

Based on a Kaggle dataset about customer churn in the telecommunication industry, my team and I attempted to determine how telco companies can reduce customer churn. To do so, we first did an EDA to see what data was in the dataset and how it needed to be cleaned and prepared for the next steps in the analysis. After the cleaning, we did some feature engineering by creating dummy columns, as well as reformatting yes/no columns to binaries. We used a logistic regression model and random forest regressor to determine feature importance and based on that, recommend what the telcos should concentrate on to reduce customer churn.
