Predicting Car Insurance Premium
The objective of this project is to leverage data-driven approaches and predictive modeling techniques to develop a robust framework for estimating car insurance costs. 
By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns within various attributes, I aim to build a predictive model that accurately forecasts insurance premiums based on 
individual characteristics. This predictive model will enable insurance companies to streamline their underwriting processes, optimize pricing strategies, and offer 
competitive premiums tailored to each customer's risk profile.
