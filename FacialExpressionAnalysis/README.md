Determining Emotional State through Facial Expression Analysis

Customer satisfaction is a primary concern for retailers because only satisfied customers are repeat customers. This project aims to create a system to automatically determine the customers' emotional state during their last interaction, 
by taking an image of their faces and running it against a model with three categories: Happy, neutral, and sad. This determination can then be used to have a managerial staff member address the customer to see if anything needs to be 
changed or fixed for the customer to go from sad or neutral to happy. The system can also be used a second time to validate the efficiency of the intervention.
