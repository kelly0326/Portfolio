Predicting the Quality Categories of Apples from Numerical Features Using Neural Networks and Decision Trees

This project created a model to predict the quality category (good/bad) of apples, based on numerical features, such as sweetness and crunchiness. By using this model, growers can successfully classify their apples for certain uses. The final model was able to predict the quality category with an accuracy of 91%
