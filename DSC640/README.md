Air Traffic is Still Safe (DSC 640)

This project was about finding and presenting data that allows the airline industry to reassure the public that flying is still safe after a set of widely publicized airline crashes. Various datasets were provided, and I chose one dataset about airline accidents going back several decades, as well as a supplemental dataset about motor vehicle crashes, to compare the safety records of both modes of transportation. The initial part of the project, as shown here, was the data visualization I did in Jupyter Notebook.
