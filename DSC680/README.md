Selecting Startup Inventory for a New Chain of Beer Stores (DSC 680)

This project about a fictitious new chain of beer stores, that needed a good startup inventory. My goal was to predict which beers the store should stock in order to have the best chance of success (i.e. good sales). I used a Kaggle dataset containing data about beer reviews. It contained information about the types of beers and the features/properties of the individual beers. I did an EDA to determine what information can be gleaned from the dataset, and what cleaning and preparation would need to be done. Once the dataset was cleaned and ready for further analysis, I used a random forest regressor to determine feature importance, then calculated the most popular beer types and beers within the types, and finally produced a list of 30 styles of beers with 20 beers in each for the stores to use.
