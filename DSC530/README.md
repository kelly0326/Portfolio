Titanic Survival (DSC 530)

Using a dataset with information about the passengers of the Titanic disaster, I did an analysis to determine what the primary factors for surviving the sinking were. I did an initial EDA to get an idea of what the data holds and what needs to be cleaned up and prepared for the analysis. I then used the chi-square test to see which variables had a strong association with survival, and I did both a multi-nominal logistic regression and a linear regression to predict the most important factors for survival.
